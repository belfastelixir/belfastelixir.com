<p>
Currently we try and hold meetings once every 4/6 weeks. We have three main types
of meetings:

<ul>
  <li>Speaking Night - several present a talk on a topic of their choice.</li>
  <li>Hack Night - collaborate on a few projects or get help on your own project.</li>
  <li>Social Night - over a coffee or a beer we discuss all things Elixir.</li>
</p>

<p>To stay informed about our upcoming meetings you can keep up to date with
#events or #elixir channels on <a
