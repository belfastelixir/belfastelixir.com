<p>
It is of primary importance that everyone who wants to participate feels safe
and welcome. When participating in Belfast Elixir, either online or offline, at
Skills Matter or at the pub afterwards, we expect you to:

<ul>
<li>behave respectfully towards other people — they’re real humans, just like you</li>
<li>be considerate of people’s time and attention</li>
<li>contribute positively and constructively to discussions (online or in-person)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
On the slack channel, we want to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio and
while the organisers will step in as soon as they see poor behaviour, we
encourage you to say something if you see it first. So please:

<ul>
<li>lead by example — if a discussion is devolving into snark and name-calling, either let it die or raise the tone</li>
<li>keep standards high — if someone acts disrespectfully, make that crystal clear to them</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Incident Handling</h2>

<p>
We want everyone to feel welcome at Belfast Elixir, regardless of gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or
technology choices. Accordingly, we will not tolerate harassment of our members
in any form; not at the talks or any Belfast Elixir social meeting; not on
Twitter or on any other online media.
</p>

<p>
Harassment includes invasions of personal space, exclusionary jokes/comments,
and sexual language and imagery in talks, but this list is non-exhaustive: if
you make anyone feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, you will be asked to leave.
</p>

<p>
If you’re still in need of clarification, there are a number of good resources
online which we encourage you read. The main thing to remember though, is that
if someone feels harassed or excluded by your words or actions, then those
words or actions constitute harassment or exclusion. Your intent is not a
factor.
</p>

<p>
All Belfast Elixir participants are accountable for their own behaviour. If
you’ve behaved badly elsewhere, that may count against you here, because of the
effect it has on other attendees.
</p>

<p>
If you experience or witness any harassing behaviour, please report it to a
member of the volunteer team.
