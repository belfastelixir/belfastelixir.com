<p>Our first meetup at <a href="http://www.shopkeep.com">ShopKeep</a>
was a success.</p>

<p>We had two great talks and a great turn out.</p>

<h4>Elixir for non-Rubyists</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mauricerkelly">Maurice Kelly</a> talked
about why Elixir isn't just for Rubyists and gave a great introductory talk
into the language.</p>

<h4>Why OTP design principles are important</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/holsee">Steven Holdsworth</a> gave us a live
coding talk and a tour of OTP and what it has to offer with regards to 
distribution and resiliency and why following them opens up a world of tooling
and compatibility.</p>
