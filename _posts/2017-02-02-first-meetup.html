<p>Please come along to our first meetup, hosted by <a href="http://www.shopkeep.com">ShopKeep</a>.</p>
<p>We have two great talks lined up.</p>
<h4>Elixir for non-Rubyists</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mauricerkelly">Maurice Kelly</a> is talking about why Elixir isn't just for Rubyists who want to be more functional society.</p>
<h4>Why OTP design principles are important</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/holsee">Steven Holdsworth</a> is giving a brief tour of OTP and what it has to offer with regards to distribution and resiliency and why following them opens up a world of tooling and compatibility.</p>
