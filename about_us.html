<p>
Belfast Elixir is a Belfast-based community for anyone who is interested in the Elixir programming language, especially beginners.
</p>

<p>We have a twitter channel @elixirbelfast - but you can find us hanging out
on the #beam channel room on <a
href='http://irishtechcommunity.com/'>Irish Tech Community</a> on Slack.</p>

<p>
Belfast Elixir provides online and offline opportunities to:

<ul>
<li>discuss Elixir and related topics</li>
<li>socialise with friendly people who are interested in Elixir</li>
<li>find or fill Elixir-related jobs</li>
<li>We want Belfast Elixir to be a diverse and inclusive community, united by
an interest in Elixir, and so we want anyone who is interested in Elixir to be
able to participate</li>
</ul>
